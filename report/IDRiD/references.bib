abstract="In this article, we propose a new method for localizing optic disc in retinal images. Localizing the optic disc and its center is the first step of most vessel segmentation, disease diagnostic, and retinal recognition algorithms. We use optic disc of the first four retinal images in DRIVE dataset to extract the histograms of each color component. Then, we calculate the average of histograms for each color as template for localizing the center of optic disc. The DRIVE, STARE, and a local dataset including 273 retinal images are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The success rate was 100, 91.36, and 98.9{\%}, respectively.",

abstract="Due to increasing number of diabetic retinopathy cases, ophthalmologists are experiencing serious problem to automatically extract the features from the retinal images. Optic disc (OD), exudates, and cotton wool spots are the main features of fundus images which are used for diagnosing eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. In this paper, a new algorithm for the extraction of these bright objects from fundus images based on marker-controlled watershed segmentation is presented. The proposed algorithm makes use of average filtering and contrast adjustment as preprocessing steps. The concept of the markers is used to modify the gradient before the watershed transformation is applied. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the test images of STARE and DRIVE databases. It is shown that the proposed method can yield an average sensitivity value of about 95{\%}, which is comparable to those obtained by the known methods.",

abstract="Automated localization and detection of the optic disc (OD) is an essential step in the analysis of digital diabetic retinopathy systems. Accurate localization and detection of optic disc boundary is very useful in proliferative diabetic retinopathy where fragile vessels develop in the retina. In this paper, we propose an automated system for optic disk localization and detection. Our method localizes optic disk using average filter and thresholding, extracts the region of interest (ROI) containing optic disk to save time and detects the optic disk boundary using Hough transform. This method can be used in computerized analysis of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The technique is tested on publicly available DRIVE, STARE, diaretdb0 and diaretdb1 databases of manually labeled images which have been established to facilitate comparative studies on localization and detection of optic disk in retinal images. The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 96.7{\%} for localization and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958 for optic detection.",
